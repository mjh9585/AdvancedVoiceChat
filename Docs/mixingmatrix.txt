Mixing Matrix: Class
<Fixed Size>

Members:
    Master Coefficients 2D array
    Vector to shove buffers into (?2-D?)

Methods:
    update - does calculations
        iterate through columns
    add channel (user)
    remove channel (user)
    <strech goal> modify_coefficent(?row?, ?column?)
    scale_vector(scalar)


Notes:
    User:
        > Has 2 buffers
            - Receive
                -get_recieve_buffer()
            - Transmit
                -get_transfer_buffer()
    Set up primitive buffer of fixed sample size
